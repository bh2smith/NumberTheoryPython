# Number Theory in Python!


This python file includes 

Classes:
- Sieve of Eratosthenes (up to $10^6$)

Functions:
- largestPrimeFactor
- factors
- numberOfFactors
- properDivisors 
- sumDivisors
- eulerPhi 
- order (of an integer modulo n)
- inverse (modulo n)
- lcm and gcd (lowest and greatest common divisors)
- egcd (similar to gcd but actually perfroms the Euclidean algorithm and returns all information)
- nCk (For binomial coefficients -- this is not an efficent algorithm)
